# GD# (GDSharp) Readme

GD# mimics C# styleguides for GDScript built-in types.

Since we've long come to understand that snake_case is terrible. There's no denying! :p


## Rationale

Looking at my GDScript scripts constantly made me lose track. 
It felt like visual noise, all lowercase and underscores made it all look the same.

As an experiment, I began to wrap all the GDScript calls to follow C# styleguide.
Et voilá: The resulting code is much cleaner, more concise, and easier to scan!

Of course that is subjective. :)

And whether it will grow, we'll see. But I love the thought of having a complete and
case-friendly wrapper library for GDScript that helps ease C# developers into the language.
Or at least it helps them with what little they actually HAVE to use it for.
